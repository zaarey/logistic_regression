# Exploring the 'Employee Retention Rate' through Logistic Regression 

By using the data from the [HR department](https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics) where I have compared impact of various factors on the employee retention rate. 

The code has 5 parts;

1. Exploratory analysis of data - prepared for regression
2. Bar chart b/w 'employee retention' and given 'salaries'
3. Bar chart b/w linked 'departments' and 'employee retention' 
4. Logistic Regression of prepared data (as done in the first step) and using 'train_test_split' function for data division 
5. Score of the overall model 

## Installation
